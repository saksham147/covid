# Description

Hello world! This is Saksham Gupta of India. This is my new CS50X(CS50's Introduction to Computer Science) project. This site provides information about For the ongoing pandemic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as the coronavirus, or COVID.

After many hair pulling moments, I finally managed to complete my final project. Its a  web application using Flask  basically show the data of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fetch the data using API(application programming interface )

API - https://api.covid19api.com/summary

Do check it out! Its quite simple but hopefully it can give some inspiration to those that have yet to complete their final project.

I obtained the data from various websites showing coronavirus data by web scraping then basically format the data to what i want csv and geojson etc. I also used various APIs such as Mapbox GL JS. Sry its currently not on air :(


COVID-19 is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.

## Implementation

## 1. First install python in your device:
## 2. open Terminal/Command prompt and execute these commands:
```
pip install Flask
```
## 3.Set the FLASK_APP environment variable:
* For Windows user
```
set FLASK_APP=app.py
```
* For Linux/Mac user
```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```
## 4. Run the Flask application with:

```
flask run
```

## HOME PAGE


There is the information of Coronavirus disease(COVID-19) world live Statistics of all the country all over the world including total cases, Recovered, and Death (inculded total cases, recovered, and Death in Twenty-four hours) with table using API in Html, CSS and JavaScript.

To access java script and/or CSS file goto static.With the help of VPN(Virtual private network) you can access COVID-19 live Statistics data of other countries very easiely like- USA(United States of America), UK(United Kingdom) and many more

### Live Data

In the live files, the case and death fields have the following definitions:

* **confirmed**: The total number of cases of Covid-19, including both confirmed and last updated.
* **recovered**: The total number of recoverd people of Covid-19, including both confirmed and last updated.
* **deaths**: The total number of deaths from Covid-19, including both confirmed and last updated.

## COVID-19 PAGE


The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.

In this page,give the Knowledge of the prevention and Symptoms of COVID-19 disease

On the prevention session ,There is instruction on what to do in this COVID-19 pandemic and what to not do in this COVID-19 pandemic.
They're the best method how to wash your hand in the six-step.

On the symptoms colume session,There are symptoms of Coronavirus disease and the steps to take to protect yourself from Coronavirus disease(COVID-19

## QUIZ and FAQs page


There is a special quiz section about the Coronavirus disease(COVID-19) to access the quiz section click on the logo or click on the button.

In which there is five question and each question there is four option, in short, there is MCQ type quiz one question = one point.

## Methodology and Definitions

The data is the product of dozens of journalists working across several time zones to monitor news conferences, analyze data releases and seek clarification from public officials on how they categorize cases.
When the information is available, we count patients where they are being treated, not necessarily where they live.

In most instances, the process of recording cases has been straightforward. But because of the patchwork of reporting methods for this data across more than 195 countries  and hundreds of local health departments, our journalists sometimes had to make difficult interpretations about how to count and record cases.

For those reasons, our data will in some cases not exactly match with the information reported by states and counties. Those differences include these cases: When the federal government arranged flights to the United States for Americans exposed to the coronavirus in China and Japan, our team recorded those cases in the states where the patients subsequently were treated, even though local health departments generally did not. When a resident of Florida died in Los Angeles, we recorded her death as having occurred in California rather than Florida, though officials in Florida counted her case in their own records. And when officials in some states reported new cases without immediately identifying where the patients were being treated, we attempted to add information about their locations later, once it became available.

* Confirmed Cases and Deaths

Cases and deaths can be reported as either “confirmed” or “probable.” Our total cases and deaths include both. The number of cases includes all cases, including those who have since recovered or died.

The World Health Organization Epidemiologists [advised states](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus) to include both confirmed cases, based on confirmatory laboratory testing, and probable cases, based on specific criteria for testing, symptoms and exposure.

Some countries continue to report only confirmed cases, while others are reporting both confirmed and probable numbers. And there is also another set of governments that is reporting the two types of numbers combined without providing a way to separate the confirmed from the probable.

The Geographic Exceptions section below has more details on specific areas. The methodology of individual states changes frequently.

* Confirmed Cases

Confirmed cases are counts of individuals whose coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test and reported by a federal, state, territorial or local government agency. Only tests that detect viral RNA in a sample are considered confirmatory. These are often called molecular or RT-PCR tests.

* Confirmed Deaths

Confirmed deaths are individuals who have died and meet the definition for a confirmed Covid-19 case. Some states reconcile these records with death certificates to remove deaths from their count where Covid-19 is not listed as the cause of death. We follow health departments in removing non-Covid-19 deaths among confirmed cases when we have information to unambiguously know the deaths were not due to Covid-19, i.e. in cases of homicide, suicide, car crash or drug overdose.

* Recovered Cases

Recovered cases are counts of individuals whose coronavirus infections were confirmed by a laboratory test and reported postive in RT-PCR tests and recovered by home quarantine.
